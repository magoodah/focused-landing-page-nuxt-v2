# Getting Started with Focused

For individuals with ADHD or ADD, maintaining consistent focus can be challenging. Traditional productivity methods often fall short because they don't address the unique way neurodivergent minds work. **Focused** is designed specifically to help bridge this gap, using AI technology to create an environment conducive to deep work.

## How Focused Works

Focused uses advanced AI to:

1. **Detect distractions in real-time**: The system monitors your screen activity to identify when you're veering off-task.
2. **Create personalized focus sessions**: Set work intervals that match your natural productivity rhythm.
3. **Provide gentle interventions**: Receive subtle nudges when distracted to help you regain focus without breaking flow.
4. **Track your productivity patterns**: Gain insights about your focus habits through comprehensive analytics.

## Setting Up Your First Focus Session

Getting started with Focused is simple:

### Step 1: Define Your Task

Begin by clearly defining what you're working on. The more specific you are, the better our AI can help identify when you're on or off task.

### Step 2: Select Session Duration

Choose a session length that works for you. We recommend starting with shorter intervals (25-35 minutes) and gradually increasing as your focus stamina improves.

### Step 3: Start Your Timer

Once you begin your session, Focused quietly monitors your activity in the background. You'll receive gentle reminders if you become distracted, helping you maintain productivity throughout your session.

## Tips for Success

- **Start small**: Begin with achievable goals and shorter focus periods
- **Use the analytics**: Review your focus patterns to identify your most productive times of day
- **Customize your settings**: Adjust the sensitivity of distraction detection to match your work style
- **Combine with other techniques**: Focused works well alongside methods like time-blocking or the Pomodoro Technique
