# 5 Productivity Techniques That Actually Work for ADHD/ADD Minds

Standard productivity advice often fails people with ADHD/ADD because it doesn't account for how neurodivergent brains function. The techniques that work best for ADHD minds leverage natural strengths while providing structure for areas of challenge.

## 1. Body Doubling

**Body doubling** is the practice of working alongside someone else, even when you're working on different tasks. This technique works because:

- It creates accountability through social presence
- It reduces the isolation that can trigger distractions
- It provides ambient motivation

**How to implement it**: Find a work buddy, join virtual coworking sessions, or use Focused's upcoming virtual body doubling feature to connect with others.

## 2. Time Blocking with Buffers

Time blocking is effective for ADHD when you build in **realistic transition periods** between activities:

- Schedule 25-minute blocks with 5-minute buffers
- Group similar tasks together to reduce context switching
- Use visual timers to create time awareness

**How to implement it**: In your calendar, explicitly schedule buffer time between activities. Treat these buffers as non-negotiable parts of your day.

## 3. Interest-Based Execution

ADHD brains are interest-driven. Rather than fighting this, use it to your advantage:

- Rotate between tasks based on current interest level
- Create artificial interest by gamifying boring tasks
- Pair less engaging tasks with rewarding elements

**How to implement it**: Create a "task menu" with 3-5 important items. Allow yourself to choose which to work on based on your current energy and interest.

## 4. External Working Memory Systems

Compensate for working memory challenges by creating robust external systems:

- Use visual task boards (physical or digital)
- Implement capture systems for fleeting thoughts
- Create checklists for routine procedures

**How to implement it**: Establish a single task management system that's always accessible. Review and update it daily.

## 5. Strategic Environment Design

Your environment powerfully influences focus ability:

- Create distinct zones for different activities
- Remove or hide visual distractions
- Use noise-cancelling headphones or background sounds

**How to implement it**: Conduct an environment audit. Identify and eliminate the top three distractions in your workspace.

## Leveraging Technology Effectively

Technology can either amplify distractions or help manage them. Focused helps you:

- Monitor your attention patterns
- Identify when you're getting off track
- Build self-awareness about your unique distractors
- Develop personalized strategies based on data

By combining these techniques with Focused's AI-powered attention monitoring, you can create a productivity system that works with—not against—your natural cognitive style.
