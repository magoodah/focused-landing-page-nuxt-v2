        The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours—is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.
      </p>

      <p>
        This policy applies to all products built and maintained by AudioScribe Technologies LLC including Focused (befocused.ai).
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect and why</h2>
      <p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:</p>

      <h3>Identity and access</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign up for Focused, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and a password. That's so you can personalize your account, we can send you updates, provide services effectively, and communicate with you about your account or service changes. We use your email address as a unique identifier for your account and to communicate with you. We also log account access by full IP address for security and regulatory compliance purposes. We keep this data for as long as your account is active.
      </p>

      <h3>Website interactions</h3>
      <p>
        When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information for troubleshooting and improving our service, both technically and functionally. We also track page views and clicks on marketing pages to understand our audience and improve our content.
      </p>

      <h3>Focus and productivity metrics</h3>
      <p>
        When you use our focus tracking features, we collect information about your focus state, distraction patterns, and productivity metrics. This data helps us provide personalized insights, reports, and coaching. The data is tied to your user account but is never shared with other users or third parties without explicit consent.
      </p>

      <h3>Screen monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        Our screen monitoring feature processes information from your screen to detect potential distractions and track your focus. This processing occurs primarily on your device, with only necessary metadata sent to our servers. Screen content is never stored permanently, and we employ strict data minimization principles to ensure your privacy.
      </p>

      <h2>When we access or share your information</h2>
      <p>
        To provide products or services you've requested, we sometimes need to share your personal information with third parties. We will never sell your personal information to third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>To provide our products</h3>
      <p>
        We use third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run our services. We maintain strict data processing agreements with all vendors who process your data.
      </p>

      <h3>To enforce compliance with our terms</h3>
      <p>
        When you create an account with us, you must agree to our Terms of Service, which limit your use of our services. We may use your information to enforce this agreement if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>When required by law</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request. We will object to requests we find inappropriate and will only provide the minimum information required unless prevented by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights with respect to your information</h2>
      <p>
        You have several rights regarding your data, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The right to access information we have about you</li>
        <li>The right to correct, update, or request deletion of your information</li>
        <li>The right to object to processing of your information</li>
        <li>The right to data portability</li>
        <li>The right to complain to a data protection authority</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you have questions about exercising these rights, please contact us at privacy@befocused.ai.
      </p>

      <h2>How we secure your data</h2>
      <p>
        All data is transmitted via HTTPS and encrypted at rest. In addition to regular security measures, we monitor our systems for unusual activity to protect against security incidents. We employ modern security measures and follow industry best practices to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2>What happens when you delete your account</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to delete your account, your personal information will be permanently deleted from our systems. We do not keep a copy of your data after account deletion except as required for legal compliance or audit purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deletion of your data will be initiated immediately upon your request, and should be completed within 30 days. Your content will be purged from backups and logs within 90 days. If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full within 60 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-canceled accounts. Please refer to our Cancellation policy for more details.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention periods for certain types of information.
      </p>

      <h2>Location of site and data</h2>
      <p>
        Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.
      </p>

      <h3>When transferring personal data from the EU</h3>
      <p>
        The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has issued guidance that personal data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that is granted under EU privacy law. UK law provides similar safeguards for UK user data that is transferred out of the UK. Accordingly, AudioScribe Technologies LLC has adopted a data processing addendum with Standard Contractual Clauses to help ensure this protection. Our DPA is available upon request.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are also a few ad hoc cases where EU personal data may be transferred to the U.S. in connection with AudioScribe Technologies LLC operations, for instance, if an EU user signs up for our newsletter or participates in one of our surveys. Such transfers are only occasional and data is transferred under the Article 49(1)(b) derogation under GDPR and the UK version of GDPR.
      </p>

      <h2>Special considerations for screen monitoring and voice coaching</h2>
      <p>
        Given the nature of our service, we want to be especially transparent about how we handle the data collected through our screen monitoring and voice coaching features:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> Our system is designed to detect patterns rather than store your actual screen content. We analyze content to detect distractions, but do not maintain a repository of your screen images beyond what's necessary for the service to function.</li>
        <li><strong>Local processing:</strong> Where possible, we process data locally on your device to minimize data transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>User control:</strong> You can pause monitoring at any time, and can configure which applications or websites should be excluded from monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice coaching:</strong> Audio output is generated based on distraction patterns and task context, but we do not record or store your voice or ambient audio.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes and questions</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify users.
      </p>
