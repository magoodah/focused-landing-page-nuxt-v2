        From everyone at AudioScribe Technologies LLC, thank you for using Focused! We built this application to help you maintain concentration and do your best work. As our user base grows, we need to establish some Terms of Service to ensure a positive experience for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say "Company", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we are referring to AudioScribe Technologies LLC.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say "Services", we mean our website, including befocused.ai, and any product created and maintained by AudioScribe Technologies LLC. That includes Focused and any related applications, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say "You" or "your", we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account on one of our Services.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Terms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to maintain the security of your account.</li>
        <li>You may not use the Services for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.</li>
        <li>Your login may only be used by one person – a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted.</li>
        <li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.</li>
        <li>For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment.</li>
        <li>If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade.</li>
        <li>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities.</li>
        <li>We process refunds according to our Refund Policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation.</li>
        <li>All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups.</li>
        <li>We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account.</li>
        <li>We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time.</li>
        <li>We are not liable to you or any third-party for the termination of your account, access, or deletion of data in your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Modifications to the Service and Prices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.</li>
        <li>Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Intellectual Property and Content Ownership</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law.</li>
        <li>We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Services. All materials uploaded remain yours.</li>
        <li>We do not pre-screen content, but reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.</li>
        <li>The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use.</li>
        <li>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Features and Bugs</h2>
      <p>
        We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Services.
      </p>

      <h2>Liability</h2>
      <p>
        You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a question about any of these Terms, please contact our Support team at <a href="mailto:support@befocused.ai" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800">support@befocused.ai</a>.
